<h1><strong>Accessibility Challenge: HTML CSS and Git</strong></h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The aim of this challenge was to refractor an exisiting site owned by a marketing agency to make it more accessible. 

The work was carried out to ensure those with disabilities can fully engage with the site. It allows them to access it using assistive technologies eg. video captions, screen readers and braille keyboards. The 'cleaner code' and added semantic HTML will also help boost the site's search engine optimisation.

This challenge helped me learn about and how to implement HTML, CSS, Git practices and code. It ensured my use of Git commands and workflow to become second nature and allowed me to apply what I have learnt in my bootcamp sessions to a 'real-life' example. It has been the first project where I have had to problem solve solo, without close direction, which was challenging and enjoyable in equal measure. 

The finer details of what I have learnt include:-
<ul>
  <li>Adding semantic HTML to the website code eg. elements such as 'header, body, main, section and footer'. This makes the site's purpose clearer for accessibility and SEO purposes.</li>
    <li>Condensing and streamlining code on the CSS sheet to create 'cleaner code' throughout.</li>
    <li>Adding 'alt text' to all images so that it's clear what the contents are a) if the website fails to load properly b) for users who are accessing the site using screen reader technology c) allowing greater success with SEO.</li>
    

I have learnt many skills during this challenge including understanding and actioning code to create the final product. It has included building on my knowledge and researching finer details of HTML semantics, CSS elements, classes and ids and logging my work on Git Hub.

I am passionate about accessiblity so this was a great first challenge!
